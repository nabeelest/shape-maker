# shape-maker
The C++ program is designed to generate a variety of geometrical shapes with the help of given coordinates. The user can input the coordinates of their choice and the program will create shapes like circles, rectangles, squares, triangles, etc. using these coordinates. The shapes are generated using basic computer graphics techniques, and the program uses the C++ programming language to implement these algorithms.
